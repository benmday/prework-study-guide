      <ul>
        <li>Elements are the different parts of code that serve unique funtions, enclosed in tags "< >" </li>
        <li>head elements contain backend code, or "metadata," that fromtend users typically do not see</li>
        <li>body elements contain frontend code that the user sees</li>
        <li>Attributes define more info about the elements, and MUST be defined at the beginning of an element, never the end</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>Inline CSS - styles an element directly in the HTML file; useful for quick and permanent change, but is less flexible</li>
        <li>Internal Style Sheet - contains CSS rules in the < head > section of the HTML file; applies to all tagged elements on that page</li>
        <li>External Style Sheet - a separate file contains all CSS rules; makes design changes easier; link the file using < link > element  in the HTML < head > element</li>
        <li>Each HTML element is a box, referred to as the CSS Box Model with margin, border, padding, and content</li>
        <li>Margin indicates how much space is around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>Padding indicates how much space is around the content inside and element</li>
        <li>DRY Code - Do not Repeat Yourself Code; applies the same rules to multiple elements to decrease size and complexity of code</li>

        <li>Markdown (.md): file format in Github; plain-text format that translates easily to HTML</li>
        <li>Commit: saving a new version of the file you're working on</li>
        <li>Pull Request (PR): merging changes from one branch to another; in the request you can review your work together with your team</li>
        <li>Merge: PR is approved and changes are merged to the main branch</li>
        <li>Issue: report new tasks/fixes; progress is tracked on the project board; "to-do" list</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switched to it</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
        <li>It programs effects, interactivity, data communication, etc.</li>
        <li>A Variable (var followed by unique variable name) is a container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li>Control Flow is the order in which the code is read; JS reads code top to bottom</li>
        <li>Conditional statements and loops are used to control the order code is executed in</li>
        <li>An Array is a single variable used to hold a group of data inside</li>
        <li>Index is the location of data inside an array; starts with value 0</li>
        <li>A For loop uses indexes to perform a task on all items in an array</li>
        <li>  1. Starting point of the loop (var x=0;)</li>
        <li>  2. Condition (x < array-name.length;)</li>
        <li>  3. Allows array to iterate over each index (x++ is used for x+1 - each time code loops, index increased by 1)</li>
        <li>A Function is a set of instructions for how to perform a certain task</li>
        <li>  -Functions do not automatically execute, they must be called by name</li>
        <li>  -Functions can be called multiple times in the same code</li>
        <li>  -First you define the function, then you call the function</li>
